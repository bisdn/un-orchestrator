The node-orchestrator is the module that controls the entire node. It receives
commands through a REST API, and takes care of implementing these commands.

More in detail, when it receives a command to deploy a new NF-FG, it does all
the operations required to actually implement this graph: retrive the network
function images, configure xDPd to create a new LSI and the ports required to
connect it to the network functions to be deployed, deploy and starts the 
network functions, and translated the rules to steer the traffic in openflow
flowmod messages to be sent to xDPd (some flowmod are sent to the new LSI,
others to the LSI-0, i.e. an LSI which steer the traffic into the proper graph.

Similarly, the node-orchestrator takes care of updating or destroying a graph,
when the proper messages are received.

      apt-get install libboost-all-dev 

* Git
      apt-get install git

Software required at runtime

* name-resolver
     ../name-resolver
     Compile it according to the description provided with the module

* DPDK
     git clone https://github.com/bisdn/dpdk-dev
     Install it according to the description provided in the downloaded archive
     
     This is not the official version of DPDK, but a patched version that provides
     better performance.

* xDPd
     git clone https://github.com/bisdn/xdpd
     cd xdpd/
     git checkout -b devel-0.7 origin/devel-0.7
     Install it according to the description provided in the downloaded folder.
     Note that you must use the the "gnu_linux_dpdk" driver, hence you have to
     add the text "--with-hw-support=gnu-linux-dpdk" when you run the "configure"
     command. You have also to add "--with-plugins="node_orchestrator rest", in order
     to run the plugin that interact with the node-orchestrator.
     
* Docker and LXC [optional]

     On Ubuntu: 
          follow the instruction provided here:
               http://docs.docker.com/installation/
          apt-get install lxc -y
          echo 'DOCKER_OPTS="-e lxc"' >> /etc/default/docker
          service docker restart

     On Debian:
          follow the instruction provided here:
              https://scottlinux.com/2014/05/04/how-to-install-and-run-docker-on-debian-wheezy/
              apt-get install docker -y
              echo 'DOCKER_OPTS="-e lxc"' >> /etc/default/docker
              service docker.io restart

* Private Docker registry [optional]
    
    To deploy and run a registry on localhost:5000, apply the following commands:
        - docker pull samalba/docker-registry
        - docker run -d -p 5000:5000 samalba/docker-registry

Compilation steps:

  cd orchestrator
  cmake .
  make
  
  Alternatively to "cmake .", you can use "ccmake .", in order to configure some
  compilation parameters. For instance, you can change the logging level and 
  enable the node-orchestrator to read the graph description from a file.
