# How to compile the un-orchestrator

In order to execute the un-orchestrator, we need to setup different components, namely:

  * a set of libraries needed to compile the un-orchestrator code
  * a virtual switch (either xDPd or OpenvSwitch) as a base switch for
    our platform
  * an execution environment for network functions, e.g., KVM for
    executing VM, Docker, or other.

### Required libraries

Several libraries are required to compile the un-orchestrator.
In the following we list the steps required on an Ubuntu 14.04.

	; Install required libraries
	; - build-essential: it includes GCC, basic libraries, etc
	; - cmake: to create cross-platform makefiles
	; - cmake-curses-gui: nice 'gui' to edit cmake files
	; - libboost-all-dev: nice c++ library with tons of useful functions
	;  -libmicrohttpd-dev: embedded micro http server
	$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake cmake-curses-gui libboost-all-dev libmicrohttpd-dev

	; Install JSON Spirit (nice library to parse JSON files)
	$ git clone https://github.com/sirikata/json-spirit
	$ cd json-spirit/

	; Now install the above library according to the description provided
	; in the cloned folder

	; Install ROFL-common  (library to parse OpenFlow messages)
	$ git clone https://github.com/bisdn/rofl-common  
	$ cd rofl-core/

	; Now install the above library according to the description provided
	; in the cloned folder

### Install the proper virtual switch

The current un-orchestrator supports different types of virtual switches.
You have to install the one that you want to use, choosing from the
possibilities listed in this section.


#### xDPd

In order to install xDPd, you have to follow the steps below.

	git clone https://github.com/bisdn/xdpd  
	cd xdpd/  

	;Install all the libraries required by the README provided in this folder  
	bash autogen  
	cd build  
	../configure --with-hw-support=gnu-linux-dpdk --with-plugins="node_orchestrator rest"   
	make

Now the DPDK library, which is being used by xDPd, must be properly
configured, which can be done by launching a script that allows you to:

  * build the environment x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
  * Insert IGB UIO module
  * Insert KNI module
  * Setup hugepage mappings for non-NUMA systems (1000 could be a
    reasonable number)
  * Bind Ethernet device to IGB UIO module (bind all the ethernet
    interfaces that you want to use)

Let's now launch the DPDK setup script:

	$ cd ../libs/dpdk/tools  
	$ sudo ./setup.sh  


#### Open vSwitch (of-config)

The list of OF-CONFIG dependencies:

- libnetconf 0.9.x, not higher
- compiler (gcc, clang,...) and standard headers
- pkg-config
- libpthreads
- libxml2 (including headers from the devel package)
- libssh >= 0.6.4 (including headers)
	- Download it from https://red.libssh.org/projects/libssh/files and for install it, follow the instructions in the INSTALL file present in a root directory
	- can be skipped if using --disable-ssh
 
- pyang >= 1.5.0
- python 2.6 or higher with the following modules:
 - os, copy, string, re, argparse, subprocess, inspect, curses, xml, libxml2
 - only with TLS enabled: M2Crypto

- only with TLS enabled by using the --enable-tls option
 - OpenSSL (libssl, libcrypto, including headers from the devel package)

- roff2html
 - optional, used for building HTML version of man pages (make doc)
- rpmbuild
 - optional, used for building RPM package (make rpm).

Compile and install libnetconf as described here, including headers from the devel package:

	; Clone the libnetconf repository
	$ git clone https://github.com/cesnet/libnetconf
    $ cd libnetconf/
    $ git checkout -b 0.9.x origin/0.9.x

Install the libnetconf library by following the instructions in the
INSTALL file contained in the root folder of this library.

You can now install of-config:

	; Clone the openvswitch repository
	$ git clone https://github.com/openvswitch/of-config    

Follow the instructions as described in the file INSTALL.md provided
in the root folder of that repository.


#### Open vSwitch (OVSDB)

######Open vSwitch Installation

At first, unpack archive with Open vSwitch source codes:

    tar -xf openvswitch-2.3.1.tar.gz

Then configure Open vSwitch using:

    ./configure --prefix=/ --datarootdir=/usr/share --with-linux=/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build

Note: we discovered bad symbolic link 'build' in /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/ in Scientific Linux 6.6,
therefore, we temporary fixed it by creating new symbolic link manually. For our case it was:

    ln -s /usr/src/kernels/2.6.32-504.8.1.el6.x86_64/ /lib/modules/2.6.32-504.el6.x86_64/build

After successful configuration of Open vSwitch, run standard commands:

    make && make install

When Open vSwitch is installed, it can be started:

    /usr/local/share/openvswitch/scripts/ovs-ctl start

To start Open vSwitch after boot:

    sed 's,/usr/share/,/usr/local/share/,' rhel/etc_init.d_openvswitch > /etc/init.d/openvswitch

    chkconfig --add openvswitch

    chkconfig openvswitch on

Note: sed(1) is used to rewrite path to Open vSwitch scripts that is statically defined
in openvswitch script.


### Virtual Execution Environment for network functions

The current un-orchestrator supports different types of execution environments.
You have to install the ones that you want to use, selecting one or more
possibilities from the ones listed in this section.

#### Docker

This is needed in order to suppor the Docker execution environment.

**On Ubuntu**

Follow the instruction provided here:

	http://docs.docker.com/installation/  

	$ sudo apt-get install lxc -y  
	$ echo 'DOCKER_OPTS="-e lxc"' >> /etc/default/docker  
	$ service docker restart

**On Debian**

Follow the instruction provided here:

	https://scottlinux.com/2014/05/04/how-to-install-and-run-docker-on-debian-wheezy/

	$ sudo apt-get install docker -y  
	$ echo 'DOCKER_OPTS="-e lxc"' >> /etc/default/docker  
	$ service docker.io restart

#### Libvirt (and KVM)

This is needed in order to run network functions in KVM-based virtual machines.

	$ sudo apt-get install libvirt-dev qemu-kvm libvirt-bin bridge-utils  

To compile and install libvirt, execute the command shown above.

If you run Libvirt for OVS or OVSDB should be put your template in a folder "compute_controller/plugins/kvm-libvirt/nf_repository".

### NF-FG library

These steps are mandatory only if you plan to use the Network Functions - 
Forwarding Graph (NF-FG) defined within the Unify project.

	; Retrieve the NF-FG library.
	
	; Copy the library in the un-orchestrator folder
	$ cp [nffg]/virtualizer3.pyc [un-orchestrator]/orchestrator/node_resource_manager/virtualizer      

### Compile the un-orchestrator

We are now ready to compile the un-orchestrator.

	$ cd orchestrator

	; Choose among possible compilation options
	$ ccmake .  

The previous command allows you to select some configuration parameters for the
un-orchestrator, such as the virtual switch used, the version of Openflow to
use, which kind of execution environment you want to enable, the NF-FG description,
etc. When you're finished, exit from the 'ccmake' interface by *generating the
configuration files* and type the following commands:

	; Create makefile scripts based on the previously selected options
	$ cmake .

	; Compile and create the executables
	$ make
